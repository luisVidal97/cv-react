                    Hi! My name is Luis Fernando Cruces Vidal and I am a software developer. 
                    Currently, I am graduated at Icesi University in Cali, Colombia. 
                    I am a tech lover who enjoys solving problems for people and organizations to improve their lives and processes. 
                    I am passionate about writing code and finding innovative ways to enhace the performance of the apps I develop.  
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I consider myself a responsible, committed, disciplined, polite and focused person. 
                    I strongly believe that being updated in this changing world is key to success in my field. 
                    Therefore, I have become a self-educated person by constantly learning new technologies. 
                    Facing challenges is a duty for me since they allow me to grow as a professional and as a person. 
                    I would be more than pleasured to it by your side. 
                    Let's start coding and enjoying!
